        <p>Have you always wanted to bake the perfect loaf of sourdough bread. Well, look no further.</p>
        <p>This recipe will show you how easy it is to achieve, provided you already have a good, ready-to-use starter.</p>
        <h3>INGREDIENTS (for one loaf):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread flour : 400g</li>
            <li>Lukewarm water: 260ml</li>
            <li>Starter: 100g</li>
            <li>Salt: 10g</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the water to a bowl and mix with the salt (with a hand).</li>
            <li>Add the starter and mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and mix with a spoon until it forms a ball.</li>
            <li>Cover and leave to rest for an hour.</li>
            <li>After one hour, mix again with a wet hand and form a ball.</li>
            <li>Leave to rest for 5 more hours.</li>
            <li>Put your dough in the fridge overnight.</li>
            <li>The next day, preheat your dish at <strong>250Â°C</strong> for 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li>While the oven is preheating, form a ball with your dough (using flour to avoid it sticking to your hands) and put it in a bread basket.</li>
            <li>After 1/2 hour, put the dough in the hot dish, score it however you want, and put the cover on the dish. </li>
            <li>Bake for 40 minutes and wait at least 1 hour before cutting your fresh bread once it is out of the oven.</li>
        </ol>
